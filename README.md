# ConcertSampler

This application is a great find for anyone that enjoy traveling! This web application allows for you to link your spotify account and get a playlist from all the artists performing in that city on the days that you are traveling there. The app makes it easy to find these with the simple steps that we have for you.
 Step 1, you will link your spotify account. 

 Step 2, you search up the city you will be traveling to. 

 Step 3, enter your dates and click get my playlist! 

This application uses two different API sources, one being Jambase and the second being Spotify. Some of the challenges we faced was finding a good source to connect the concert data to the user and getting our playlist to contain not only one artist but a few tracks from all of the artists that are performing on those specific dates. We used bootstrap for some of the UI components in addition to google fonts to create a fun interactive application for the user.
